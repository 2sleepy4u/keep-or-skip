## Keep or Skip

This is a tool to keep your pc tidy and organize pictures.  
I've made this app to organize media files transferred from a complete backup from my phone.  
Lots of videos and pictures gets all piled up in the phone memory, without us realizing it; when we then move media
from our phone to our pc we end up with thousant of file which we do not want to keep in their entirity.  
This tool let you decide which file to keep or which to "skip" (get rid off), by organizing them in 2 directories: Keep / Skip.  

This tool was inspired by the Tinder mechanic of swiping right and left.  
Use the right and left arrow to swipe
